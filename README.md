Wordbank
========

Wordbank is an open database for storing information about children's vocabulary growth.

Check out the web front-end at [wordbank.stanford.edu](http://wordbank.stanford.edu), where you can explore interactive visualizations, view analyses, and download subsets of the data.

You can also pull the data directly into R using the [wordbankr package](https://github.com/langcog/wordbankr). See the package's [vignette](http://langcog.github.io/wordbankr) for a tutorial.
