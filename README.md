Wordbank
========

Wordbank is an open database for storing information about children's vocabulary growth.

Check out the web front-end at [wordbank.stanford.edu](http://wordbank.stanford.edu/), where you can view some analyses and download subsets of the data as csv files.

You can also pull the data directly into R using these [data loading functions](https://github.com/langcog/wordbank/blob/master/shiny_apps/data_loading.R). This [tutorial](http://wordbank.stanford.edu/tutorial) gives some examples of accessing and analysing the data.
