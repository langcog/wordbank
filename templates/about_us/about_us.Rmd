Wordbank is an open database of childrenâ€™s vocabulary growth, featuring data from [contributors around the world](http://wordbank.stanford.edu/contributors). 

Wordbank archives data from the [MacArthur-Bates Communicative Development Inventory (MB-CDI)](http://mb-cdi.stanford.edu), a family of parent-report questionnaires and enables researchers to browse these data in [interactive analyses](http://wordbank.stanford.edu/analyses) and access them via the [wordbankr](http://github.com/langcog/wordbankr) R package.
