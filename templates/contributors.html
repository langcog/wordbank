<div class="lead">
  <p>Thank you to all of the generous researchers who have contributed data to Wordbank!</p>
</div>

<ol id="citation_rules">
  <li>Researchers publishing or presenting work using data in the Wordbank database must cite the publications linked to that dataset, as shown below in the contributors list. (If there is no linked citation, then no citation for the individual dataset is necessary).</li>

  <li>For tracking use of the database and its affiliated tools, please also cite: Frank, M. C., Braginsky, M., Yurovsky, D., & Marchman, V. A. (2016). Wordbank: An open repository for developmental vocabulary data. Journal of Child Language. doi: 10.1017/S0305000916000209. <a href="http://langcog.stanford.edu/papers_new/frank-2016-jcl.pdf">[pdf]</a></li>

  <li>If researchers use more than five datasets, we ask users as a courtesy to cite all data. But in case of severe space limitations, the database as a whole may be cited.</li>

  <li>In addition, since the site contains many unpublished English datasets, users of the full English dataset need only cite the Wordbank database. Users of the normative English data (accessed by selecting "normative data only") should cite Fenson et al. (2007) as below.</li>

  <li>Some datasets may be marked with a <img alt="CC BY NC License 4.0" src="{% static 'images/ccbync.large.png' %}" style='width: 2%;'> logo. This signifies that these datasets are licensed under a <a href="https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc/4.0/">Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial 4.0 International License</a>. This means these datasets may not be used for commercial purposes but are otherwise free to be used and adapted as long as credit is given.</li>

  <li>Since the Wordbank site is dynamic, we recommend that you list the date of download for your data in your manuscript. For example: "In these analyses, item-level responses were extracted from all available forms in English from Wordbank (Frank et al., 2016). Data were downloaded on 3/20/17."</li>
</ol>

<p>To contribute your data, please email <a href="mailto:wordbank-contact@stanford.edu">wordbank-contact@stanford.edu</a>.</p>
<p>Use of Wordbank data for the development of new CDI instruments is permitted, but must be approved by the CDI Advisory Board. Developers planning on use of Wordbank data for this purpose should see the Adaptations Guidelines on the <a href="https://mb-cdi.stanford.edu/adaptations.html">CDI website</a>.</p>
