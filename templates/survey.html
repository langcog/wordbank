<p>Turker: You have been given a list of "semantic features" that have been used to describe the word shown in bol at the top of this page. Your task is to go through each row in the list and identify rows that have the same meaning as other rows. When you identify such a row, change the name of the row with the smaller frequency (indicated by the seocond column) to match exactly the name of the row with the larger frequency. To give an example of what we're looking for:</p>
<ul>
	<li>Suppose you have the word "bicycle." "Has two wheels" and "has wheels" should be condensed into the larger frequency row.</li>
        <li>Suppose you have the word "tree." "Made of wood" and "wooden" should be condensed into the larger frequency row.</li>
        <li>Suppose you have the word "pipe." "Thin and long" and "large" should NOT be condensed. The meanings do not quite match up.</li>
</ul>

<p>Some other rules of thumb:</p>
<ul>
        <li>You are also asked to delete rows with a frequency of 1 that do not seem to match with any other row.</li>
        <li> When you have doubts about what to do, you should default to NOT changing or deleting the row.</li>
</ul>
