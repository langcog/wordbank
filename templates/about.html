<p>Wordbank archives data from the MacArthur-Bates Communicative Development Inventory (MB-CDI), a family of parent-report questionnaires. The Wordbank database enables researchers to recover data filtered by source, age, gender, word, and a host of other variables, enabling simple export of plain-text data for further analysis.</p>
<p>Wordbank also include a number of reports based on recent research on children’s vocabulary: see how children’s vocabulary grows and changes across early childhood.</p>
