<p>Wordbank archives data from the MacArthur-Bates Communicative Development Inventory (MB-CDI), a family of parent-report questionnaires. The Wordbank database enables researchers to recover data filtered by source, age, gender, word, and a host of other variables, enabling simple export of plain-text data for further analysis.</p>
<p>Wordbank also include a number of reports based on recent research on children’s vocabulary: see how children’s vocabulary grows and changes across early childhood.</p>
<p>Wordbank is open access! The graphical search interface is currently under construction, but see <a href="http://rpubs.com/dyurovsky/using-wordbank">this tutorial</a> to start using <a href="http://www.r-project.org/">R</a> to analyze the data today.
<p>We began development on Wordbank in Spring 2014. Stay tuned for further updates.</p>
