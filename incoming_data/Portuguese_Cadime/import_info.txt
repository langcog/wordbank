Dear Dr. Frank,

Please find attached our databases. Please be aware that, in the 8-15 months database, the items labeled VR correspond to comprehension and the items labeled VE correspond to production.
I will try to send you the translation in a couple of weeks, during Easter break.

Wish you a nice weekend.
Best regards,
Irene
