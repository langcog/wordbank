I’m sending an excel file with the CG CDI data, 177 kids in total from 5 age groups, with information about gender.
Along with the data, there’s a translation of each item in sheet 2. Next to the translation, or as part of the translation, there are often some comments. Whenever you see “CG” next to the word it means that this is a Cypriot Greek word, not to be found in Standard Modern Greek. When you see quotation marks, it means that I’ve written a definition of the meaning, instead of the actual translation of the word, if a direct translation does not exist/apply. When there is a verb involved, when you see -PASSIVE next to the verb it means that the meaning of the word is in passive voice. For example, wash-PASSIVE means “I wash myself”. And when you see something in brackets next to the meaning, it restricts the meaning of the word to something more specific than the English word would allow. For example, in the case of the Pronoun category, you will find “that (female singular)”, “that (male singular)” and “that (neutral singular)”, because the word appears with different endings which define the gender. Let me know if all this is clear or if you need any further explanations.
I also attach a pdf file with the tool.
It is sooo exciting that we are finally joining Wordbank J
