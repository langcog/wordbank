This app allows browsing of semantic networks using a variety of similarity measures. Currently, these include overlap on the McRae features (following the analyses reported in [Hills et al., 2009, Psych Science](http://www.iub.edu/~cogdev/labwork/PsychSci_Hills.pdf), and cosine similarity in a word2vec model of the language in CHILDES. Filters allow control over what words are included in the network via their age of acquisition (estimated from Wordbank data), and the kind and strength of the semantic relations that link two concepts.
