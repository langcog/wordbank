This app allows browsing of semantic networks following the analyses reported in [Hills et al., 2009, Psych Science](http://www.iub.edu/~cogdev/labwork/PsychSci_Hills.pdf). Networks are computed on the basis of semantic feature overlap (via the McRae association norms). Filters allow control over what words are included in the network via their age of acquisition (estimated from Wordbank data), how many semantic features in common are needed to establish a link between two concepts, and the source of these semantic features (perceptual vs. conceptual).
