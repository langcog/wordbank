The vocabulary norms report shows all administrations of a particular CDI instrument within the instrument's valid age range. Lines on the plot indicate estimates of percentiles, fit using quantile regression with monotonic polynomial splines as the base function (Muggeo et al., 2013; gcrq package in R).

The norming reports in Wordbank are dynamically generated applying sophisticated curve-fitting procedures that make a particular set of assumptions. Morever, Wordbank norming reports reflect currently available data culled from different sources that may not be identical to those included in the norming samples for a particular instrument. In particular, users should be aware that the values provided by Wordbank for English and Spanish are based on different participants and are estimated following different computational procedures than the values published in the Userâ€™s Guide and Technical Manual (Fenson et al., 2007; Jackson-Maldonado et al., 2003) and applied in the CDI Scoring program (Marchman, 2013, mb-cdi.stanford.edu/scoringdb_p.htm).

In general, we do not recommend that Wordbank-generated norming values be used for research or clinical purposes in which the goal is to evaluate children's performance in reference to an established normative standard (e.g., determining the mean words produced percentile of a group of children in a study; classifying whether the performance of an individual child falls below the 10th percentile). For these types of applications in English and Spanish, users should refer to the norms and guidelines published in the manuals for those languages (available through Brookes Publishing Co, www.brookes.com). For similar applications in other languages, users should refer to the appropriate manuals and norming information, as listed on the contributors page.
