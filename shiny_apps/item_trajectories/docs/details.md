__Plot description__. This plot shows the mean proportion producing or understanding the selected items. Points show individual age group averages, lines show a local polynomial regression 
smoothing line (`loess` in `R`). If the "both" form option is selected, forms are 
distinguished by their marker, but a single function fit is shown.
